I grew up in Wellesley, MA and attended Wellesley High School, where I developed a strong interest in mathematics and the natural Sciences. Later, I pursued a double major in mathematics and physics at Bates College, while also exploring the exciting realm of computer science. Currently, I am working towards my PhD. at Virginia Tech, aiming to learn as much as possible and hone my problem solving skills.
